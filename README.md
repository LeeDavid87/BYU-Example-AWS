# BYU-Example-AWS

### This is my first program I have ever written in Python. Everything done in this program was learned from the time the email was sent until now

Install the following if you do not already have them installed:

Flask and boto

Example:

Emphasis, pip install Flask

Emphasis, pip install boto

Can be done with gitBash or Command line

Create a folder and clone the project into said folder using git bash

once cloned, navigate to BYU-Example-AWS
then type the command: python app.py

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000/

If you have any questions running it, please let me know
